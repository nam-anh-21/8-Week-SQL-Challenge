## 1. Which interests have been present in all month_year dates in our dataset?
(*)
``` sql
DECLARE @month_year_count INT = (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT month_year)
    FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
);

SELECT mp.id, mp.interest_name, mp.interest_summary
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics mt
INNER JOIN fresh_segments.interest_map mp
    ON mt.interest_id = mp.id
GROUP BY mp.id, mp.interest_name, mp.interest_summary
HAVING COUNT(month_year) = @month_year_count;
```
|id|interest_name|interest_summary|
|---|---|---|

## 2. Using this same total_months measure - calculate the cumulative percentage of all records starting at 14 months - which total_months value passes the 90% cumulative percentage value?
The total_month of 6 would surpass the 90% cumulative percentage value.
``` sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS #interest_months;

SELECT interest_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT month_year) AS total_months
INTO #interest_months
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
GROUP BY interest_id;

WITH interest_count AS (
    SELECT total_months,
        COUNT(interest_id) AS interests
    FROM #interest_months
    GROUP BY total_months
)

SELECT *,
    CAST(SUM(interests) OVER(ORDER BY total_months DESC) * 100.0 /
        SUM(interests) OVER() AS DECIMAL(10, 2)) AS cumulative_pct
FROM interest_count
ORDER BY total_months DESC;
```
|total_months|interests|cumulative_pct|
|---|---|---|
|14|480|39.93|
|13|82|46.76|
|12|65|52.16|
|11|94|59.98|
|10|86|67.14|
|9|95|75.04|
|8|67|80.62|
|7|90|88.10|
|6|33|90.85|
|5|38|94.01|
|4|32|96.67|
|3|15|97.92|
|2|12|98.92|
|1|13|100.00|



## 3. If we were to remove all interest_id values which are lower than the total_months value we found in the previous question - how many total data points would we be removing?

### 3.1. Answer
``` sql
WITH interest_months AS (
    SELECT interest_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT month_year) AS total_months
    FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
    GROUP BY interest_id
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT month_year) <= 6
)

SELECT COUNT(interest_id) AS interests_to_remove,
    COUNT(DISTINCT interest_id) AS unique_interests_to_remove
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
WHERE interest_id IN (
    SELECT interest_id 
    FROM interest_months
);
```
|interests_to_remove|unique_interests_to_remove|
|---|---|
|598|143|
