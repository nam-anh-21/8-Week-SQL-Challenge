## 9. Can we use the avg_transaction column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?
We cannot calculate the average of avg_transaction to find average transaction size. Let's consider the concept of distribution.
Each set of numbers represents a different distribution with its own shape. When we calculate the average of a set, we are finding the central tendency of that specific distribution. Taking an average of averages assumes that each distribution has a similar shape, which may not be true.
Thus, combining these averages does not accurately represent the central tendencies of the individual distributions or provide an accurate overall average. As a result, to calculate the average transaction size correctly, we need to take the average of all the individual transaction values for each year and platform. The below result demonstrates both methods.
``` sql
SELECT calendar_year, platform,
    ROUND(AVG(avg_transaction), 2) AS inaccurate_average_transaction,
    ROUND(CAST(SUM(sales) AS FLOAT) / CAST(SUM(transactions) AS FLOAT), 2) AS accurate_average_transaction
FROM data_mart.weekly_sales_cleaned
GROUP BY calendar_year, platform
ORDER BY calendar_year, platform;
```
|calendar_year|platform|inaccurate_average_transaction|accurate_average_transaction|
|---|---|---|---|
|2018|Retail|42.91|36.56|
|2018|Shopify|188.28|192.48|
|2019|Retail|41.97|36.83|
|2019|Shopify|177.56|183.36|
|2020|Retail|40.75|36.74|
|2020|Shopify|173.5|177.59|
