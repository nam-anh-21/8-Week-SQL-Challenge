## Question
In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the data_mart schema named clean_weekly_sales:
- Convert the week_date to a DATE format
- Add a week_number as the second column for each week_date value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc
- Add a month_number with the calendar month for each week_date value as the 3rd column
- Add a calendar_year column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values
- Add a new column called age_band after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value
- Add a new demographic column using the following mapping for the first letter in the segment values
- Ensure all null string values with an "unknown" string value in the original segment column as well as the new age_band and demographic columns
- Generate a new avg_transaction column as the sales value divided by transactions rounded to 2 decimal places for each record */
