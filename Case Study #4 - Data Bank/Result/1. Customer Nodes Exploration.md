# 1. Customer Nodes Exploration

## 1. How many unique nodes are there on the Data Bank system?
``` sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT node_id) AS unique_nodes
FROM data_bank.customer_nodes;
```
|unique_nodes|
|---|
|5|



## 2. What is the number of nodes per region?
``` sql
SELECT r.region_id, r.region_name,
    COUNT(n.node_id) AS nodes_count
FROM data_bank.customer_nodes n
INNER JOIN data_bank.regions r
    ON n.region_id = r.region_id
GROUP BY r.region_id, r.region_name
ORDER BY r.region_id;
```
|region_id|region_name|nodes_count|
|---|---|---|
|1|Australia|770|
|2|America|735|
|3|Africa|714|
|4|Asia|665|
|5|Europe|616|



## 3. How many customers are allocated to each region?
``` sql
SELECT r.region_id, r.region_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT n.customer_id) AS customers_count
FROM data_bank.customer_nodes n
INNER JOIN data_bank.regions r
    ON n.region_id = r.region_id
GROUP BY r.region_id, r.region_name
ORDER BY r.region_id;
```
|region_id|region_name|customers_count|
|---|---|---|
|1|Australia|110|
|2|America|105|
|3|Africa|102|
|4|Asia|95|
|5|Europe|88|



## 4. How many days on average are customers reallocated to a different node?
``` sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS #customer_dates;

SELECT customer_id, region_id, node_id,
    MIN(start_date) AS first_date
INTO #customer_dates
FROM data_bank.customer_nodes
GROUP BY customer_id, region_id, node_id;

WITH reallocation AS (
    SELECT customer_id, node_id, region_id, first_date,
        DATEDIFF(DAY, first_date, 
        LEAD(first_date) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY first_date)) AS moving_day
  FROM #customer_dates
)

SELECT ROUND(AVG(CAST(moving_day AS FLOAT)), 2) AS avg_moving_day
FROM reallocation;
```
|avg_moving_day|
|---|
|23.69|



## 5. What is the median, 80th and 95th percentile for this same reallocation days metric for each region?
``` sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS #customer_dates;

SELECT customer_id, region_id, node_id,
    MIN(start_date) AS first_date
INTO #customer_dates
FROM data_bank.customer_nodes
GROUP BY customer_id, region_id, node_id;

WITH reallocation AS (
    SELECT customer_id, node_id, region_id, first_date,
        DATEDIFF(DAY, first_date, 
        LEAD(first_date) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY first_date)) AS moving_days
  FROM #customer_dates
)

SELECT DISTINCT re.region_id, rg.region_name,
    ROUND(PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY r.moving_days) OVER(PARTITION BY r.region_id), 2) AS median,
    ROUND(PERCENTILE_CONT(0.8) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY r.moving_days) OVER(PARTITION BY r.region_id), 2) AS pctile_80,
    ROUND(PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY r.moving_days) OVER(PARTITION BY r.region_id), 2) AS pctile_95
FROM reallocation re
INNER JOIN data_bank.regions rg ON re.region_id = rg.region_id
WHERE moving_days IS NOT NULL;
```
|region_id|region_name|median|pctile_80|pctile_95|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|Australia|22|31|54|
|5|Europe|22|31|54.3|
|3|Africa|21|33.2|58.8|
|2|America|21|33.2|57|
|4|Asia|22|32.4|49.85|
